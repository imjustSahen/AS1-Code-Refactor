# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Project Title

Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

Assignment One was to review the starter code provided and optimize the site for Web Accessibility and consildate any repetitive or inefficient code. I added in alt tags for images, changed the page title to something relevant, and replaced non-despriptive syntax. This should help both with accessibility and SEO. I consolidated the HTML code from 82 lines down to 69 and the CSS code from 200 lines down to 133. I also adjusted the navigation bar to stick with the page as the user scrolls and added some mild interactions for the user when they hover over the navigation options.
